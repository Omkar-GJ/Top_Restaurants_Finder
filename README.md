# Top_Restaurants_Finder

Python script to fulfill the following requirements:

	1. Prompt the user to enter the name of a city.
	2. Retrieve the top 10 restaurants in the specified city based on the food, comparing ratings and reviews through a Google search.
	3. Store the collected restaurant data in a JSON file, using the restaurant names as keys and their relevant details (such as ratings and reviews) as values.
Note:
To fetch Google search results and review data, I used SerpAPI (a Google Search API) which is legal and provides structured access to Google results including reviews and ratings.
